Hi, I'm Marios.

This is my GitHub where I plan on sharing projects, notes, thoughts, coursework and works in progress. I mostly use R for statistical analysis, Python for OCR and image/ text processing, and Julia for computation.

**I am currently working on:**  
Replicating the model from "Trade and Domestic Distortions: The Case of Informality" in Julia. 

Digitizing trade data from the 40-60s USA- repo coming soon. 

**Favourite Book:**  
The 39 Steps by Buchan

**Currently reading:**  
Nature's Metropolis by Cronon 

**Favourite TV Show:**  
Arrested Development
